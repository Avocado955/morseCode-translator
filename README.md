# Morse Code Translator

## MVP

- Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code

- Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

  - translate their English text into Morse Code
  - Morse Code into English text

- Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

- Add unit tests for all of your non-dom functions

## How to use:

- Provide a English or Morse Code string into the correct Text Area
- The last clicked text area will be the one translated
- Click the translate button, this will print out the translated text into the opposite Text Area
- Currently any symbols inside of the English text area will cause an error to be displayed when trying to translate
